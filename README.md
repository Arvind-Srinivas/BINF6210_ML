# Building a Taxonomic Classifier for the Cytochrome B gene among Ar#odactyla, Carnivora, and Squamata

This project looks to create a classifier using supervised machine learning, to discern
between diﬀerent taxonomic groups based on a common/conserved marker code. The marker
code in ques5on is the Cytochrome B (CytB) gene, which is widely used as a marker gene for
vertebrates due to it being highly conserved. In general, this mitochondrial
gene produces a protein that plays a role in energy metabolism and works in tandem with the
electron transport chain. While the gene is typically found in a similar form
across diﬀerent taxa, varia5ons in its nucleo5de composi5on are s5ll expected. Therefore,
developing a classifier can be par5cularly valuable, especially when dealing with well-conserved
genes. This project focuses on building a classifier to discern between the CytB gene of
Ar#odactyla (hoofed animals), the CytB gene of Carnivora (carnivorous animals), and the CytB
gene of Squamata (rep5les) by looking at nucleo5de propor5ons and 4-mers. The more
sequence data available, the beSer the classifier would be when dealing with unseen data.
